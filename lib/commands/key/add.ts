		Add an SSH key to balenaCloud.

		Add an SSH key to the balenaCloud account of the logged in user.

		If \`path\` is omitted, the command will attempt to read the SSH key from stdin.

		About SSH keys
		An "SSH key" actually consists of a public/private key pair. A typical name
		for the private key file is "id_rsa", and a typical name for the public key
		file is "id_rsa.pub". Both key files are saved to your computer (with the
		private key optionally protected by a password), but only the public key is
		saved to your balena account.  This means that if you change computers or
		otherwise lose the private key, you cannot recover the private key through
		your balena account. You can however add new keys, and delete the old ones.

		To generate a new SSH key pair, a nice guide can be found in GitHub's docs:
		https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
		Skip the step about adding the key to a GitHub account, and instead add it to
		your balena account.
